# The Open Field Mill Project
The Open Field Mill Project is an open source project created to study and
measure the build up of electrostatic charge. Ultimately the device will be
used to make high quality measurements on a full-size helicopter to assess the
effectiveness of electrostatic discharge devices and assess the dangers associated
with static during hoisting operations.

Even though the device is planned to be used for real life measurements, the primary
objective is to get a better understanding of _Electrostatics_ as well as _Electronics Engineering_
while still keeping a tight DIY budget. The project is based
on a [Field Mill published by James A. Campbell](http://www.precisionstrobe.com/jc/fieldmill/fieldmill.html).
