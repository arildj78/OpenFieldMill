# The Open Field Mill Project
The Open Field Mill project is an open source project created to study and
measure the buildup of electrostatic charge. Ultimately the device will be
used to make high quality measurements on a full size helicopter to assess the
effectiveness of electrostatic discarge devices and assess the dangers associated
with static during hoisting operations.

Even though the device is planned to do real life measurements, the primary
objective is to gain better knowledge of Electrostatics and Electronics Engineering
while still keeping a tight DIY budget. The project is open source and is based
on a [Field Mill design by James A. Campbell](http://www.precisionstrobe.com/jc/fieldmill/fieldmill.html).
